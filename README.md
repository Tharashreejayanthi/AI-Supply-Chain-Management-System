A comprehensive AI-powered system that transforms traditional supply chain processes through intelligent forecasting, IoT integration, real-time tracking, and automated vendor communication.

---

## 📑 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a multi-phase academic research initiative to build a scalable and intelligent **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** system. Using **AI, FastAPI, IoT simulation, and ML**, it streamlines inventory management, optimizes demand forecasting, enhances supplier communication, and ensures secure data handling.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting** using linear regression and simulated machine learning.
- **IoT Integration** for real-time temperature, humidity, and device tracking.
- **Chatbot Automation** for vendor inquiries.
- **Secure Transaction Logging** via SHA-256 hashing.
- **FastAPI RESTful Backend** for inventory updates, demand prediction, and sensor data.
- **Real-Time Dashboards and Visualization** (code stubs available).
