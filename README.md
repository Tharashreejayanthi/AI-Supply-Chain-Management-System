# 📦 AI-Supply Chain Management System

A comprehensive AI-powered platform that modernizes traditional supply chain operations through intelligent forecasting, IoT integration, real-time tracking, and automated vendor communication.

---

## 📑 Project Overview

This project is part of a multi-phase academic research initiative aimed at developing a scalable and intelligent **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** system. Utilizing **AI, FastAPI, IoT simulation, and machine learning**, it enhances inventory management, optimizes demand forecasting, improves supplier communication, and ensures secure data handling.

## 🧠 Core Features

* **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting** using linear regression and simulated ML.
* **IoT Integration** for real-time tracking of temperature, humidity, and device activity.
* **Automated Chatbot** to handle vendor inquiries.
* **Secure Transaction Logging** with SHA-256 hashing.
* **RESTful Backend via FastAPI** for inventory updates, demand prediction, and sensor data.
* **Real-Time Dashboards** and visualizations *(code stubs provided)*.
